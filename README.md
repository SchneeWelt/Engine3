# Engine3
Simple Java Game Engine


Engine3 is a simple java game engine. Feel free to use it and / or send feedback to improve this engine even further.
I used this engine or as it is in the moment fileSystem quiet often in different projects. After all im happy with it.
The Engine is written in java open jdk 15. Versions down to open jdk 11 should also work. 
 
Engine3 does not support infinity ticks per second. However it uses double buffering as default
