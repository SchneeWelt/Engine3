# Engine3
Simple Java Game Engine


Engine3 is a simple java game engine. Feel free to use it and / or send feedback to improve this engine even further.
I used this engine for many different projects. I think that this engine can be a good one although it is really basic.
The Engine is written in java open jdk 15. Versions down to open jdk 11 should also work. I think that I used Records at some point. So if there is an error with them
feel free to create a static class which has the same properties as the record.
 
Engine3 does not support infinity ticks per second. However it uses double buffering set as default. The default Tick Rate is 30 Ticks per second. Ticks are cpu based...

Please note that not all classes are made public now. Some classes like collision testing classes or other tools are currently private. I will add them as soon as I find them
